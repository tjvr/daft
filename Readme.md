# daft

**work in progress**

- A functional dataflow language
- Super-friendly, general-purpose, usable by non-programmers
- [Scratch](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-blocks/wiki/Design) + [Snap!](http://snap.berkeley.edu/) + [IPython](http://ipython.org/) + spreadsheets
- Intermediate results are visible

there are some screenshots & videos [on Twitter](https://storify.com/blob8108/daft)

Use cases:

- science: process data, make graphs
- automation: process lists of email addresses or contacts
- finance: a more powerful spreadsheet
- databases: lists and relationships and querying and so on; built-in persistence is a must
- anything you'd use a spreadsheet for
- anything I'd use a quick Python script/IPython notebook for
- image processing
- apps/UI, eventually
- collabarative programming, eventually
